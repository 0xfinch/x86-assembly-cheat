# IA-32

# x86

Instruction set that dominates the desktop market on Windows, Mac and Linux.

The official name is IA-32 commonly known as x86 or x86-32 or i386.

This section shall contain info on the entire family.

Majority of PCs use it as of 2013. Cell phones use ARM mainly.

AMD also produces CPUs with a compatible interface.

CISC.

Backwards compatible to the 1970s!

## Implementations

Intel and AMD are the major ones.

Cyrix was an implementor before being bought by National Semiconductor, and VIA continue to produce them after buying Cyrix from NS.

## Syntaxes

There is no de facto standard for the computer syntax

### Intel

Used to document Intel x86 at first

More popular on windows

Used by NASM and MASM.

#### AT&T

More popular for Linux, since UNIX was created at bell labs,

## Pinout

It is a good idea to understand what are the physical pins of the processor and what they do to understand what is actually going on when you do instructions

## Registers

Registers store data in the processor.

Most CPU operations operate on and or use registers values.

There are very few registers compared to RAM slots because of the memory hierarchy tradeoff: CPU register access is extremely fast, but the cost of each register is extremely high.

Suffixes:

- `B`: byte
- `W`: word = 2 bytes
- `D`: double word = 2 words = 4 bytes
- `Q`: quadword = 4 words = 8 bytes
- ?: double quadword = 2 quadowrds = 16 bytes

### access modes

For 32 bit registers, most instructions allow to operate on either:

- 32 bits. Called extended. ex: `eax`
- 16 lower bits. E.g.: `ax`
- 8 lower bits. `al`
- 8 upper bits. `au`

### general purpose registers

There are 8 general-purpose 32 bit registers (`gpr`):

- EAX
- EBX
- ECX
- EDX
- ESI
- EDI
- EBP
- ESP: used stack pointer.

In theory, those can be used freely for many computations such as sums, subtractions, etc.

However, some instructions make extensive use of certain of those registers such as `ESP` which keeps track of the stack.

Therefore, you should rely primarily on `eax`, `ebx` and `ecx` as actually being general purpose, and even for those you should check often if each operation will not take input/output from them without you knowing it.

### Flags register

Each bit represents a boolean

Types:

- FLAGS: 16 lower bits
- EFLAGS: (extended) refers to the 16 upper bits only, or the entire register

Some of those values may be modified as of by other operations such as comparisons or sums, to indicate certain conditions

Some of the flags are:

- SF sign

- ZF zero

1 if result == 0

- PF parity

0 lower 8 bits of result

- CF carry

- OF overflow

- AF adjust

- IF interrupt flag

This flag says if interrupts are enabled or disabled in the current processor

This can be useful for synchronization

It can only be set / cleared by a processes with sufficient privileges normally one that runs in kernel space, such as kernel code of as a Linux kernel module

For that reason, its usage cannot be demonstrated here, but only in an OS depend ant manner.

All flags can be identified by a single letter. Ex: zero flag Z, sign flag S.

#### Flag instructions

Flags have the following operations defined

- clear: clX.  flag = 0
- set: stX.    flag = 1
- complement: cmX.    flag = !flag

All flags also have short jump instructions:

- jX:  jump if X == 1
- jnX: jump if X == 0

### Segment instruction pointer register

A 32 bit segment instruction pointer called EIP.

Points to the address of the next instruction to be executed.

Is normally increased by 4 bytes after the execution of each instruction.

It can be read by use applications.

### Segment registers

They are usually only useful for operating system writers, and can only be modified when in kernel mode.

See [this](#segmentation) for an explanation of what those do.

User level programs usually do not have permission to modify those registers.

-   6 16 bit segment registers

    - SS: start of stack segment
    - DS: start of data segment
    - CS: start of code segment
    - ES, FG, GS: are free for programs to define.

Each segment register has a corresponding read only 8 byte Segment descriptor register, which automatically pulled in from RAM when a segment is changed.

### CR registers

### Control registers

Control registers, CR0 to CR4.

Usually not accessible by user applications, only kernel mode.

Control very important parameters of the mode of operation of the processor.

Their exact functions may be too complicated to describe here, and will be left for other sections.

#### CR0

1 bit flags that determine how the CPU operates.

Some interesting flags are:

- 31. PG. Paging. If 1, enable paging and use the CR3 register, else disable paging.
- 30. CD. Cache disable. Globally enables/disable the memory cache.
- 29. NW. Not-write through. Globally enables/disable write-back caching.
- 18. AM. Alignment mask. Alignment check enabled if AM set, AC flag (in EFLAGS register) set, and privilege level is 3.
- 16. WP. Write protect. Determines whether the CPU can write to pages marked read-only.
- 0. PE. Protected Mode Enable. If 1, system is in protected mode, else system is in real mode.

#### CR1

Reserved by Intel for future use.

#### CR2

Used by the paging system.

After a segmentation fault, stores the value of the address access attempt that caused the fault.

#### CR3

Used by the paging system.

Points to the current Page Table, Directory, or Pointer table depending on the values of PAE and PSE.

#### CR4

1 bit flags that determine how the CPU operates.

Some of the flags are:

- 5 PAE. Physical Address Extension. If set, changes page table layout to translate 32-bit virtual addresses into extended 36-bit physical addresses.
- 4 PSE. Page Size Extension. If unset, page size is 4 KB, else page size is increased to 4 MB (or 2 Mob with PAE set).

### Other registers

- FPU registers for floating point operations
- SIMD registers MMX and XMM for SIMD instructions

## Real mode

The other memory operation mode besides protected mode

## Protected mode

Is the normal mode of operation.

The other main mode is called real mode, which exists mainly for backwards compatibility.

The processor starts on real mode only for backwards compatibility.

Starting from 386, mode is determined by the `PE` (protect enable) bit of the CR0 register. If set, protected mode is active. If clear, real mode is active.

Protected mode furnishes two things: memory segmentation and paging.

Those two features are basic to modern operating system implementations.

The hardware supports these two feature to make it faster, and automatically interacts with data stored on RAM when needed.

Before entering protected mode, the software must first set up the required RAM data.

## Address types

There are 3 types:

- logical
- linear
- physical

### Logical address

A 16 bit segment + a 32 bit offset.

With segmentation, can be translated to a 32 bit address only.

### Linear address

32 bit address, may be modified by paging before translation to a physical address.

### Physical address

The actual electrical signals that go on the address memory cable.

## Cache

### Cache sources

-   [Stallings - 2011 - Operating-Systems-Internals](http://www.amazon.com/Operating-Systems-Internals-Principles-Edition/dp/013230998X) section "Cache Memory"

    Small and good introduction to the subject.

### Associativity

TODO

### Write back policy

-   write through: always write to RAM immediately. Not efficient.

-   not write through: writes to  RAM can happen only when the cache content is about to be invalidated.

    RAM remains on an outdated state for some time, which may lead to concurrency issues.

The policy can be controlled via the `NR` bit of `cr0`.

## Interrupts

The processor has a pin which receives interrupts.

Whenever an interrupt is received, a piece of code defined by the user is executed. This piece of code is called an interrupt service routine (ISR).

The interrupt has a number which can vary from 0 to 255 and which helps identify the interrupt

There are 3 main applications to interrupts:

-   system calls on both Linux and Windows are called via interrupts generated by user programs via the `int` instruction

-   when a program must wait for some hardware input such as key press, it lets other programs run, and when the keypress is done this generates an interrupt from hardware origin.

    This dispenses the program from periodically checking if the input has finally come or not (pooling) and thus consuming CPU time for nothing.

-   exceptions for error handling

    Certain operations such as division by 0 or trying to access memory without permission generates an interrupt called an exception.

    The exception code allows the programmer to deal with the error.

    Interrupts between 0x0 and 0x1F are reserved for processor exceptions. list: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt_descriptor_table>

The instructions which deal with interrupts are:

- `int n`: generate a software interrupt. Used to make system calls.
- `ireX n`: generate interrupt n if flag X is set
- `iret`: return from current ISR to old code

TODO how to register an ISR

TODO check the predefined INT 10 and other predefined ones! <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INT_10H>

## SIMD

Single instruction multiple data.

Do exactly what the name says, for example, 4 multiplications on a single CPU cycle!

It is in general hard to manually port code that was not originally designed to use SIMD instructions and the same goes for compilers.

Introduced later as extensions to the original x86.

Sources:

- <http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Assembly/SSE>
- <http://www.songho.ca/misc/sse/sse.html>

MMX, SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4 are the version names

SIMD instructions use the following registers:

- 8 64 bit registers called MMX[0-7]
- 8 128 bit registers called XMM[0-7]
- 1 MXCSR

In this way you can add, subtract, multiply, etc. 4 floats/2 doubles at once without taking into account overheads you can go up to 4x faster.

As all of assembler, you will have a hard time beating modern compiler optimizers with this, so beware... still lots of fun though!

You have to try to align data on 16 bytes to make instructions go faster this is done with the align directive

## Driver IO instructions

The following instructions are used to communicate with hardware such as hard disks mouses and so on.

They cannot be used on user level programs.

- IN: Read from a port
- OUT: Write to a port
- INS/INSB: Input string from port/Input byte string from port
- INS/INSW: Input string from port/Input word string from port
- INS/INSD: Input string from port/Input doubleword string from port
- OUTS/OUTSB: Output string to port/Output byte string to port
- OUTS/OUTSW: Output string to port/Output word string to port
- OUTS/OUTSD: Output string to port/Output doubleword string to port
