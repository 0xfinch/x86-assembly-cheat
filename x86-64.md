# x86-64

# x86_64

# x64

# AMD64

64 bit architecture, originally by AMD, and implemented by both AMD and Intel.

Intel calls their implementation "Intel 64" but it used "IA-32e" and "EM64T" before, AMD says AMD64, Apple x86-64 and x86_64, and Microsoft and Oracle x64. Notice the great naming uniformity.

x86-64 is compatible with IA-32: you can feed the exact same bytes into it and it will still work.

## Major differences

The major difference added in x86-64 is the possibility of making 8 byte operations instead of 4. Most (TODO all?) operations still exist and are analogous.

`PUSHA` and `POPA` don't exist anymore. <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6837392/how-to-save-the-registers-on-x86-64-for-an-interrupt-service-routine> It seems that this is because AMD needed more place for new instructions, and because those instructions could already be done with other instructions. TODO doesn't this break backwards compatibility?
