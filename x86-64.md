# AMD64

64 bit architecture, originally by AMD, and implemented by both AMD and Intel.

Intel calls their implementation "Intel 64" but it used "IA-32e" and "EM64T" before, AMD says AMD64, Apple x86-64 and x86_64, and Microsoft and Oracle x64. Notice the great naming uniformity.

Do not confuse with IA-64, which is the old name for the Itanium architecture, a completely different architecture developed by Intel, which largely lost to the x86-64 alternative that AMD first proposed.

## x86-64 vs IA32

x86-64 has a compatibility mode which allows running IA32 code directly on it.

In 64-bit mode, outside of compatibility mode, most instructions are analogous, but a few have been removed.

The major difference added in x86-64 is the possibility of making 8 byte operations instead of 4.

Most operations still exist and are analogous but some have changed or been removed. But if you turn on compatibility mode, it works with IA32 code.

- quadword `RAX`, `RBX`, `RCX`, `RDX`, `RDI`, `RSI`, `RBP`, `RSP`, `R8` - `R15` version of `EAX`, `EBX`, `ECX`, `EDX`, `EDI`, `ESI`, `EBP`, `ESP`, `R8D` - `R15D` added

- `PUSHA` and `POPA` were removed: <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6837392/how-to-save-the-registers-on-x86-64-for-an-interrupt-service-routine>
- some instructions do not work with operand sizes for which they work in 32 bit mode. E.g., you cannot do `pop eax`, only `pop rax`.

## Long mode

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_mode>

Contains two sub-modes: 64-bit and compatibility.

The other mode is legacy mode, which as the name implies, should not be used on new programs.

### Compatibility mode

Controlled by the `CS.L` bit of the segment descriptor.

It appears that it is possible for user programs to modify that during execution: <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12716419/can-you-enter-x64-32-bit-long-compatibility-sub-mode-outside-of-kernel-mode>
