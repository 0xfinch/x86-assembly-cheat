very popular architecture family by intel

the official name is IA-32 commonly known as x86 or x86-32 or i386

this section shall contain info on the entire family

majority of pcs today use it

AMD also has compatible cpus

cisc

backwards compatible to the 1970s !

# history

## intel 8080

1974, 8 bit, 2Mhz, very popular

## intel 8086

1976, 16 bit, very popular, base to x86 language

## intel 80386

aka i386

1985, 32 bit word register

## intel 8087

1980

external floating point coprocessor for 8086

included inside cpus starting from hte 80436

x87 often used to describe the floating point operations
inside the processors

instructions include:

- FSQRT
- FSIN

## intel 80486

1989

includes floating point unity

# syntaxes

there is no de facto standard for the computer syntax

## intel

used to document intel x86 at first

more popular on windows

used by nasm and masm

### at&t

more popular for linux, since unix was created at bell labs,
and since gnu uses at&t syntax as backend and as the primary inline assembly language.

# pinout

it is a good idea to understand what are the physical pins of the processor and
what they do to understand what is actually going on when you do instructions

![8086 pinout a](8086-pinout.gif "8086 pinout")

# registers

registers store data in the processor

suffixes:

- B: byte
- W: word = 2 bytes
- D: double word = 2 words (a c ``int``)
- Q: quad word
- T: ten bytes

## acess modes

for 32 bit registers, most instructions allow to operate on either:

- 32 bits. called extended. ex: `eax`
- 16 lower bits. ex: `ax`
- 8 lower bits. `al`
- 8 upper bits. `au`

list of all registers.

## general purpose registers

there are 8 general-purpose 32 bit registers (gpr):

- eax
- ebx
- ecx
- edx
- ESI
- EDI
- EBP
- ESP: used stack pointer.

in theory, those can be used freely for many computations
such as sums, subtractions, etc

however, some instructions make extensive use of certain of those registers
such as `ESP` which keeps track of the stack.

therefore, you should rely primarily on eax, ebx and ecx as actually being genral purpose,
and even for those you should check often if each operation will not take input/output from them
without you knowing it

## flags register

each bit represents a boolean

types:

- FLAGS: 16 lower bits
- EFLAGS: (extended) refers to the 16 upper bits only, or the entire register

some of those values may be modified as of by other operations
such as comparisons or sums, to indicate certain conditions

some of the flags are:

- SF sign

- ZF zero

1 if result == 0

- PF parity

0 lower 8 bits of result

- CF cary

- OF overflow

- AF adjust

- IF interrupt flag

this flag says if interrupts are enabled or disabled in the current processor

this can be useful for synchronization

it can only be set / cleared by a processes with sufficient privileges
normaly one that runs in kernel space, such as kernel code of as a linux kernel module

for that reason, its usage cannot be demonstrated here,
but only in an OS dependant manner.

all flags can be identified by a single letter. Ex: zero flag Z, sign flag S.

###flag instructions

flags have the following operations defined

- clear: clX.  flag = 0
- set: stX.    flag = 1
- complement: cmX.    flag = !flag

all flags also have short jump instructions:

- jX:  jump if X == 1
- jnX: jump if X == 0

## segment instruction pointer register

is a 32 bit segment intruction pointer called EIP

points to the address of the next instruction to be executed

is normally increased by 4 bytes after the execution of each instruction

## segment registers

- 6 16 bit segment registers

    - SS: start of stack
    - DS: start of data
    - CS: start of code
    - ES, FG, GS

TODO what do those do exactly?

## other registers

besides the previous registers, there are also:

- fpu registers for floating point operations
- SIMD registers MMX and XMM for SIMD instructions

# interrupts

the processor has a pin which receives interrupts

whenever an interrupt is received, a piece of code defined by the user
is executed. This piece of code is called an interrupt service routine (ISR)

the interrupt has a number which can vary from 0 to 255 and which helps
identify the interrupt

there are 3 main applications to interrupts:

- system calls on both linux and windows are called via interrupts generated by user programs
    via the `int` instruction

- when a program must wait for some hardware input such as key press, it lets other programs
    run, and when the keypress is done this generates an interrupt from hardware origin.

    this dispenses the program from periodically checking if the input has finally come or not (pooling)
    and thus consuming cpu time for nothing.

- exceptions for error handling

    certain operations such as division by 0 or trying to access memory without perission
    generates an interrupt called an exception.

    the exception code allows the programmer to deal with the error.

    interrupts between 0x0 and 0x1F are seserved for processor exceptions. list: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt_descriptor_table>

the instructions which deal with interrupts are:

- `int n`: generate a software interrupt. Used to make system calls.
- `ireX n`: generate interrupt n if flag X is set
- `iret`: return from current ISR to old code

TODO check the predefined INT 10 and other predefined ones! <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INT_10H>

# simd

single instruction multiple data

do exactly what the name says, for example, 4 multiplications on a single cpu cycle!

it is however hard to port code that was not originally designed to use them to do so,
and the same goes for compilers.

those were intruced later as extensions to the original x86

sources:

- <http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Assembly/SSE>
- <http://www.songho.ca/misc/sse/sse.html>

MMX, SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4 are the version names

SIMD instructions use the following registers:

- 8 64 bit registers called MMX[0-7]
- 8 128 bit registers called XMM[0-7]
- 1 MXCSR

in this way you can add, subtract, multiply, etc 4 floats/2 doubles at once
disconsidering overeads you can go up to 4x faster

as all of assembler, you will have a hard time beating modern compiler optimizers
with this, so beawere... still lots of fun though!

you have to try to align data on 16 bytes to make instructions go faster
this is done with the align directive

# driver io instructions

the following instructions are used to communicate with hardware such as hard disks
mouses and so on. They cannot be used on user level programs.

- IN            Read from a port
- OUT           Write to a port
- INS/INSB      Input string from port/Input byte string from port
- INS/INSW      Input string from port/Input word string from port
- INS/INSD      Input string from port/Input doubleword string from port
- OUTS/OUTSB    Output string to port/Output byte string to port
- OUTS/OUTSW    Output string to port/Output word string to port
- OUTS/OUTSD    Output string to port/Output doubleword string to port
