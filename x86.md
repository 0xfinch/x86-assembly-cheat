#pinout

it is a good idea to understand what are the physical pins of the processor and
what they do to understand what is actually going on when you do instructions

#registers

Registers store data in the processor.

Most CPU operations operate on and or use registers values.

There are very few registers compared to RAM slots because of the memory hierarchy tradeoff:
CPU register access is extremelly fast, but the cost of each register is extremelly high.

Suffixes:

- B: byte
- W: word = 2 bytes
- D: double word = 2 words (a c `int`)
- Q: quad word
- T: ten bytes

##acess modes

For 32 bit registers, most instructions allow to operate on either:

- 32 bits. called extended. ex: `eax`
- 16 lower bits. ex: `ax`
- 8 lower bits. `al`
- 8 upper bits. `au`

list of all registers.

##general purpose registers

there are 8 general-purpose 32 bit registers (gpr):

- eax
- ebx
- ecx
- edx
- ESI
- EDI
- EBP
- ESP: used stack pointer.

In theory, those can be used freely for many computations
such as sums, subtractions, etc

However, some instructions make extensive use of certain of those registers
such as `ESP` which keeps track of the stack.

Therefore, you should rely primarily on `eax`, `ebx` and `ecx` as actually being genral purpose,
and even for those you should check often if each operation will not take input/output from them
without you knowing it.

##flags register

Each bit represents a boolean

Types:

- FLAGS: 16 lower bits
- EFLAGS: (extended) refers to the 16 upper bits only, or the entire register

some of those values may be modified as of by other operations
such as comparisons or sums, to indicate certain conditions

some of the flags are:

- SF sign

- ZF zero

1 if result == 0

- PF parity

0 lower 8 bits of result

- CF cary

- OF overflow

- AF adjust

- IF interrupt flag

this flag says if interrupts are enabled or disabled in the current processor

this can be useful for synchronization

it can only be set / cleared by a processes with sufficient privileges
normaly one that runs in kernel space, such as kernel code of as a linux kernel module

for that reason, its usage cannot be demonstrated here,
but only in an OS dependant manner.

all flags can be identified by a single letter. Ex: zero flag Z, sign flag S.

###flag instructions

flags have the following operations defined

- clear: clX.  flag = 0
- set: stX.    flag = 1
- complement: cmX.    flag = !flag

all flags also have short jump instructions:

- jX:  jump if X == 1
- jnX: jump if X == 0

##segment instruction pointer register

A 32 bit segment intruction pointer called EIP.

Points to the address of the next instruction to be executed

Is normally increased by 4 bytes after the execution of each instruction

It can be read by use applications.

##segment registers

They are usually only useful for operating system writers,
and can only be modified when in kernel mode.

See [this](#segmentation) for an explanation of what those do.

User level programs usually do not have permission to modify those registers.

- 6 16 bit segment registers

    - SS: start of stack segment
    - DS: start of data segment
    - CS: start of code segment
    - ES, FG, GS: are free for programs to define.

Each segment register has a corresponding read only 8 byte Segment descriptor register,
which automatically pulled in from RAM when a segment is changed.

##cr registers

Control registers, cr0 to cr4.

Usually not accessible by user applications, only kernel mode.

Control very imporatnt parameters of the mode of operation of the processor.

Their exact functions may be too complicated to describe here,
and will be left for other sections.

- cr0:

    1 bit flags that determine how the CPU operates.

    PE: protect enable. Determines if processor is on protected mode or real mode.

- cr1: reserved by Intel for furture use.

- cr2:

    Used by the paging system.

    After a segmentation fault, stores the value of the address access attempt that caused the fault.

- cr3:

    Used by the paging system.

    Points to the current Page Table.

- cr4:

    1 bit flags that determine how the CPU operates.

    - PSE: page size extension. Turns PAE on and off.

##other registers

- FPU registers for floating point operations
- SIMD registers MMX and XMM for SIMD instructions

#rings

IA-32 implements a priviledge system.

There are in total 4 priviledge levels, also called rings, from 0 to 3,
but most operating systems use only 2: kernel space and user space, usually
with values 0 and 3.

Rings are useful for OS programmers.
The OS lets user programs run a restricted set of operations
limiting the ammount of damage that a badly working or badly intentioned program can do.
Obviously this only works because user programs are then in a state in which they cannot
modify their own priviledge levels without the OS intervening.

Certain operations such are only allowed if certain priviledges are given.

Priviledge control is only available on protected mode, and is managed by segmentation and paging.

#real mode

The other memory operation mode besides protected mode

#protected mode

Is the normal mode of operation.

The other main mode is called real mode, which exists mainly for backwards compatibility.

The processor starts on real mode only for backwards compatibility.

Starting from 386, mode is determined by the `PE` (protect enable) bit of the CR0 register.
If set, protected mode is active. If clear, real mode is active.

Protected mode furnishes two things: memory segmentation and paging.

Those two features are basic to modern operating system implementations.

The hardware supports these two feature to make it faster,
and automatically interacts with data stored on RAM when needed.

Before entering protected mode,
the software must first set up the required RAM data.

#address types

There are 3 types:

- logical
- linear
- physical

##logical address

A 16 bit segment + a 32 bit offset.

With segmentation, can be translated to a 32 bit address only.

##linear address

32 bit address, may be modified by paging before translation to a physical address.

##physical address

The actual electrical signals that go on the address memory cable.

#segmentation

Only available on protected mode.

Splits memory into smaller pieces.

Makes the transition from logical to linear adresses.

Its usage is obligatory on protected mode.

This feature was meant to be used to implement processe virtual memory spaces,
but this usage has been mostly supplanted by a later implemented fetaure called paging.
In Linux for example, only two segments are used at all times:
one for the kernel, and one for all user processes.

##RAM interaction

Segmentation needs the CPU interact with the RAM data structures called gloabl descriptor
tables and local descriptor tables.

While it could be implemented with software, it is implemented on the hardware level
because segmentation operations must be done at *every* memory access operation,
so they have to be really fast.

This also takes the burden off operating system writers.

The operating system must however initialized and keep parts of the RAM structures
up to date on it own so that the CPU can use them.

##global descriptor table

RAM data structure that holds segment information.

The segment information data structure is called a *segment descriptor*.

Each segment descriptor is identified and retreived via a *segment selector* structure.

##segment selector

Has the following fields:

- index: 13 bits to identify the Segment descriptor.

    There can therefore be up to 2^13 segment descriptors on the system.

- RPL: Request priviledge level.

    The priviledge level of the code that will execute a Code segment.

- TI: 1 bit table indicator. If set, indicates that this is a local descriptor table.

    Otherwise, it is a global descriptor table.

##segment descriptor

Segment descriptors reside in RAM, and are pulled into a processor register automatically
when a Segment selector that points to them is put into a Segment register.

Each segment descriptor is 8 bytes long, and contains information such as the following.

- BASE: 32 bit start address and end address of the segment

- LIMIT: 20 bit segment length. This is multiplied by $2^12$ if G is set
    so the maxium length is 4Gb ($2^32$).

    Minimum length is 4 Kb. TODO 0 for pages?

- G: granularity flat. If set, LIMIT is in multiples of $2^12$ bytes, else multiples of 1 byte.

- DPL: 2 bit priviledge level.

    Compared to the priviledge level of the Segment Selector to determine if users have or not
    permission to take certain actions ( the rings are based on this )

- Type: 4 bit type field. Some of the types are:

    - Code: indicates a code segment. It is on this case the premissions to take actions are checked.

    - Data:

    - TSSD: task state segment descriptor. The segment contains saved register values (bewteen process sleeps)

    - LDTD: the segment contains a local descriptor table

- S: system

    If set, indicates that the RAM of that segment contains important structures such as Local descriptor table.

Whenever a new segment descriptor is loaded into the register, a segment

The global descriptor table can be loaded with the command:

    lgdt

##local descriptor table

Holds the same data as the Global descriptor table.

TODO local to what?

#paging

##example: simplified paging motivation

This shows intuitivelly how paging operates on a simple 32 bit architecture without PAE
to implement a virtual memory space.

To fit two processes on a single RAM, the OS could give them the following Page Tables.

Page table 1 used by Process 1:

    page     physical address   present
    -----    -----------------  --------
    0x00000  0x00001            1
    0x00001  0x00000            1
    0x00002  0x00002            1
    0x00003                     0
    ...                         ...
    0xFFFFF  0x00005            1

Page table 2 used by Process 2:

    page     physical address  present
    -----    ----------------- --------
    0x00000  0x0000A           1
    0x00001  0x0000B           1
    0x00002                    0
    0x00003  0x00003           1
    ...      ...               ...
    0xFFFFF  0x00004           1

The OS creates and modifies those tables on RAM memory on any location,
and each process cannot touch any page tables directly.

A Page is a chunk of 4Kib (12 bits), and since addresses have 32 bits,
only 20 bits ( 20 + 12 = 32 ) are required to identify each page.
This value is fixed by hardware for efficiency reasons.

A Page Table is... a Table of Pages! Given the number of a page,
the page table contains the corresponding Page.

When the OS wants to activate Process 1, it sets the `cr3`
register to point to the RAM address Page table 1, wherever the OS stored it.

If Process 1 wants to access linear address `0x00000001`,
the paging *hardware* circuit automatically does the following for the OS:

- split the linear address into two parts:

    - the page `0x00000`
    - the offset: `0x001`

- look into Page table 1 becaues `cr3` points to it.

- look entry `0x00000` because that is the page part.

- since it is present, the access is valid

- by the page table, the location of page number `0x00000` is at `0x00001`.

- the final physical address will be:

          0x00001 000
        + 0x00000 001
          -----------
          0x00001 001

- the hardware then gets the memory at that physical location.

In the same way, the following translations would happen for process 1:

    linear     physical
    -------    ---------
    0x0000002  0x0001002
    0x0000003  0x0001003
    0x0000FFF  0x0001FFF
    0x0001000  0x0000000
    0x0001001  0x0000001
    0x0001FFF  0x0000FFF
    0x0002000  0x0002000
    0xFFFF000  0x0005000

When the OS wants to switch to process 2, all it needs to do is to make `cr3` point to page 2.
It is that simple!

Now the following translations would happen for process 2:

    linear     physical
    -------    ---------
    0x0000002  0x0001002
    0x0000003  0x0001003
    0x0000FFF  0x0001FFF
    0x0001000  0x0000000
    0x0001001  0x0000001
    0x0001FFF  0x0000FFF
    0x0003000  0x0003000
    0xFFFF000  0x0004000

*The same linear address tranlates to difference physical addresses for different processes*,
depending only on the value inside `cr3`.

In this way every program can expect its data to start at 0 and end at FFFFFFFF,
without worrying about exact physical addresses.

###page fault

What if Procees 1 tries to access an address inside a page that is no present?

The hardware notifies the software via a Page Fault Exception.

It is then usually up to the OS to register an exception handler to decide what has to be done.

It is possible that accessing a page that is not on the table is a programming error:

    int is[1];
    is[2] = 1;

but there may be cases in which it is acceptable, for example in Linux when:

- the program wants to increase its stack.

    It just tries to accesses a certain byte in a given possible range,
    and if the OS is happy it adds that page to the process address space.

- the page was swapped to disk.

    In that case, the OS will need to do some work behind the processes back to get the page back into RAM.

In any case, the OS needs to know which address generated the Page Fault to be able to deal with the problem.
This is why the nice IA32 developers set the value of `cr2` to that address whenever a Page Fault occurs.
The exception handler can then just look into `cr2` to get the address.

###simplifications

Simplifications to reality that make this example easier to understand:

- all real paging cirtuits use multi level paging to save space,
    but this showed a simple single level scheme.

- page tables contained only two fields: a 20 bit address and a 1 bit present flag.

    Page tables also contain other fields which have been ommited.

- part of the 4Gb address space may be reserved for the kernel.

    This is the case of Linux, which reserves the one tope 1Gb for the kernel,
    which never switches pages.

TODO complete

##general info

Used to implement processes virtual address spaces on modern OS.
This feature came after segmentation, and largely replaced it for this purpose.
The key idea is that *each process has its own page table*.
Swapping between the RAM memory of two processes is a simple matter of changing
the current page table, which is indicated by the `cr3` register.

Paging splits RAM into equal sized chunks called pages.

Paging is only available on protected mode.

Its usage is optional on protected mode.

Just like for segmentation, paging interacts with RAM data structures.
It could be done via software but is hardware implmented since paging operations
are done at every single memory access and need to be very fast.

The paging unit does things like:

- transform linear addresses into physical adresses

    Without paging, the linear address is exactly the physical address.

- check access rights, and throw a Page Fault exception in case of insufficient rights.

##why not use segmentation

Virtual process memory spaces could be implemented with segments,
but modern OS, including Linux, all use paging for that reason.

TODO explain why

The main difference between paging and semgmentation comes down to the fact that
paging divides memory into chunks of equal sizes, while segments don't have fixed sizes.

##multi level paging scheme

The naive way to implement paging would be *for each process*
to store a map of the physical address of each possible page.

For example, a single level page table for process would look like:

    page     physical address
    -----    -----------------
    0x00000  0x00001
    0x00001  0x00000
    ...
    0xFFFFF  0xFFFFF

This method would have the merit of being very fast. If the program want to access for example
adress `0x00002001`, then all that is needed is to lookup the corresponding physical address for page `0x00002`,
which in this example is at `0x00001`, and then add `001` to it. This is simple because `0x00002` is the second
table entry, and all table entries have the same size and are stored contigously.

The problem with this method is that it would take up too much RAM: 4G / 4K = 1M entries *per* process.
So x86 developers decided to use a multi level scheme
that reduces RAM usage at the cost of slightly higher access time.

In the simple 3 level paging scheme used for 32 bit processors without PAE,
the 32 address bits are divided as follows:

    | directory (10 bits) | table (10 bits) | offset (12 bits) |

Each process has an entire page directory associated to it:

    page directory   page table address
    ---------------  -------------------
    0x00000          0x00001
    0x00001          0x00000
    0x00002          ( not present )
    ...
    0xFFFFF          0xFFFFF

so it will contain at least `2^10 = 1K` page directory entries,
much better than the 1M required on a single level scheme.

Next, only used pages need a corresponding page table.

The fundamental idea is using the present flag of page directories and page tables
to decide if a table is contained in memory or not.

TODO continue

##page table

Data structure that is used to map liner addresses to physical ones.

##TLB

The Translation Lookahead Buffer (TLB) is a cache for paging addresses.

It is implemented as an expensive type of RAM that
implements an associative map on hardware, that is,
a structure that given a key (linear address), retreives a value.

This is different from regular RAM, which given an *address* retreives a value.

For example, a map in which:

- both keys and values have 20 bits
- at most 4 values need to be stored at each time

could be stored in a TLB with 4 entries:

    0x00000 0x00001
    0x00001 0x00010
    0x00A00 0x00100
    0x10000 0x01000

However, to implement this with RAM, *it would be necessary to have 2^20 addresses*,
which would be even more expensive than using the TLB.

#interrupts

the processor has a pin which receives interrupts

whenever an interrupt is received, a piece of code defined by the user
is executed. This piece of code is called an interrupt service routine (ISR)

the interrupt has a number which can vary from 0 to 255 and which helps
identify the interrupt

there are 3 main applications to interrupts:

- system calls on both linux and windows are called via interrupts generated by user programs
    via the `int` instruction

- when a program must wait for some hardware input such as key press, it lets other programs
    run, and when the keypress is done this generates an interrupt from hardware origin.

    this dispenses the program from periodically checking if the input has finally come or not (pooling)
    and thus consuming cpu time for nothing.

- exceptions for error handling

    certain operations such as division by 0 or trying to access memory without perission
    generates an interrupt called an exception.

    the exception code allows the programmer to deal with the error.

    interrupts between 0x0 and 0x1F are seserved for processor exceptions. list: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt_descriptor_table>

the instructions which deal with interrupts are:

- `int n`: generate a software interrupt. Used to make system calls.
- `ireX n`: generate interrupt n if flag X is set
- `iret`: return from current ISR to old code

#simd

Single instruction multiple data.

Do exactly what the name says, for example, 4 multiplications on a single cpu cycle!

It is in general hard to manually port code that was not originally designed to use SIMD instructions
and the same goes for compilers.

Intruced later as extensions to the original x86.

Sources:

- <http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Assembly/SSE>
- <http://www.songho.ca/misc/sse/sse.html>

MMX, SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4 are the version names

SIMD instructions use the following registers:

- 8 64 bit registers called MMX[0-7]
- 8 128 bit registers called XMM[0-7]
- 1 MXCSR

in this way you can add, subtract, multiply, etc 4 floats/2 doubles at once
disconsidering overeads you can go up to 4x faster

as all of assembler, you will have a hard time beating modern compiler optimizers
with this, so beawere... still lots of fun though!

you have to try to align data on 16 bytes to make instructions go faster
this is done with the align directive

#driver io instructions

the following instructions are used to communicate with hardware such as hard disks
mouses and so on. They cannot be used on user level programs.

- IN            Read from a port
- OUT           Write to a port
- INS/INSB      Input string from port/Input byte string from port
- INS/INSW      Input string from port/Input word string from port
- INS/INSD      Input string from port/Input doubleword string from port
- OUTS/OUTSB    Output string to port/Output byte string to port
- OUTS/OUTSW    Output string to port/Output word string to port
- OUTS/OUTSD    Output string to port/Output doubleword string to port
