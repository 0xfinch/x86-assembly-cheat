# Other Popular architectures

This tutorial focuses only on the x86 architecture families.

Here are some other popular architectures which you should have in mind as well:

-   PowerPC <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC>

    Created by IBM, Motorola and Apple.

    But IBM and Motorola are dying, Apple moved to Intel in 2005 for power efficiency, Xbox One and PlayStation 4 moved to x86-64 in 2013.

    Used on Nintendo GameCube (2001) up to Wii U (2012), PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

    Was meant to be the ultimate RISC beats Intel and Windows coalition, but it failed.

-   SPARC <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARC>

    Created by Sun for its operating system Solaris. Now owned and used by Oracle. Not used much by anyone else.

## ARM

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture>

Great majority of mobile phones.

Low power consumption.

RISC.

## MIPS

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_instruction_set>

Used mostly on embedded systems, and notably video game consoles: Nintendo 64, Sony PlayStation, PlayStation 2.

Officially supported on Android.

Imagination Technologies bough MIPS Technologies: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagination_Technologies>

Seems closed.

Open implementation: <https://brej.org/yellow_star/> TODO legal?

### Open implementations

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber_%28processor_core%29 TODO how does it compare in performance / cost?

ARM has already sued people in the past for implementing ARM ISA: http://www.eetimes.com/author.asp?section_id=36&doc_id=1287452 so not open.

## Operating systems

Linux runs on all of the above and more: just do a `ls arch` to see the full list.

TODO Windows and Mac OS? Likely they support only x86 on desktop, and have separate ARM portable versions that share some codebase.
